&lt;p&gt;Here at Greatist, we're always looking for ways to make our favorite foods healthier without sacrificing flavor. So we compiled a list of our best substitutions and discovered some new ones along the way. Below are our 83 (!) top picks, guaranteed to make that next meal a delicious, healthier hit. It wasn't easy taste-testing all this food, but someone sure had to. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Baking hacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Black beans for flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping out flour for a can of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.babble.com/family-kitchen/2011/01/21/gluten-freeblack-bean-brownies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;black beans&lt;/a&gt; (drained and rinsed, of course) in brownies is a great way to cut out the gluten and fit in an extra dose of protein, Plus, they taste &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. When baking, swap out 1 cup flour for 1 cup black bean puree (about a 15oz can).&lt;/p&gt;

[AD]

&lt;h4&gt;2. Whole wheat flour for white flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In virtually any baked good, replacing white flour with whole wheat can add a whole new dimension of nutrients, flavor, and texture. Because whole wheat includes the outer shell of the grain, it also provides an extra punch of fiber, which aids in digestion and can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;lower the risk &lt;/a&gt;of diabetes and heart disease. For every cup of white flour, substitute 7/8 cup of whole-wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Baking_Applesauce.png?itok=jRt64tob&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use unsweetened applesauce instead of sugar&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Unsweetened applesauce for sugar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using applesauce in place of sugar can give the necessary sweetness without the extra calories and, well, sugar. While one cup of unsweetened applesauce contains only about 100 calories, a cup of sugar can pack in more than 770 calories! This swap is &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delish.com/recipefinder/applesauce-cookies-recipes-sugar-free&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oatmeal raisin cookies&lt;/a&gt;. Pro tip: You can sub sugar for apple sauce in a 1:1 ratio, but for every cup of applesauce you use, reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by 1/4 cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Unsweetened applesauce for oil or butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&rsquo;t knock this one till you&rsquo;ve tried it. The applesauce gives the right consistency and a hint of sweetness without all the fat of oil or butter. This works well in any sweet bread, like banana or zucchini, or in muffins (like in these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yummly.com/recipe/Blueberry-Low_fat-Muffins-Recipezaar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;low-fat blueberry muffins&lt;/a&gt;)&mdash;and even with pre-boxed mixes! On your first try, only try swapping out half the fat (so a recipe using 1 cup of oil would use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce). If you can't tell the difference with that swap, try swapping a bit more of the fat next time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5. Almond flour for wheat flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gluten-free switch gives any baked good a dose of protein, omega-3s, and a delicious nutty flavor. Check out these classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elanaspantry.com/butter-cookies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;butter cookies&lt;/a&gt; for a simple example. A word of advice: almond flour is much heavier than other baking flours, so when subbing go 1/4 cup at a time (so 1 cup wheat flour would become 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1/4 cup almond flour). Or, if it's all or nothing for your recipe, remember to increase the amount of rising agent (by about 1/2 teaspoon per cup of almond flour added) to account for the extra weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Baking_AvocadoPuree.png?itok=VEaTlEe1&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use avocado puree instead of butter&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6. Avocado puree for butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&rsquo;re both fats (albeit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;very different fats&lt;/a&gt;) and have nearly the same consistency at room temperature. The creaminess and subtle flavor of the avocado lends itself well to the texture of fudge brownies and dark chocolate flavorings. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesimplelens.com/2011/05/byeeee-byeeee-brownie/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; for perfect proportion guidelines. It can take some experimenting to get this swap perfect, but generally, using 1 cup of avocado puree per cup of butter works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;7. Brown rice cereal with flax meal for Rice Crispies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown puffed rice has the same texture as conventional white rice, but with half the calories. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/flaxseed/AN01258&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;flax&lt;/a&gt; adds extra fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and phytochemicals to the mix without compromising flavor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;8. Marshmallow Fluff for frosting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing the fat and sugar in frosting with marshmallow achieves the perfect consistency with &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; fewer calories. While two tablespoons of marshmallow has just 40 calories and 6 grams of sugar (and no fat!), the same amount of conventional frosting can pack up to 100 calories, 14 grams of sugar, and 5 grams of fat. Need we go on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;9. Natural peanut butter for reduced-fat peanut butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they may appear better than traditional Skippy or Jiff, reduced fat versions of peanut butter can actually have more sugar&mdash;and an extra-long list of artificial additives&mdash;than the classics. Natural peanut butter (preferably unsalted) provides the same sweetness without call the extra junk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10. Vanilla for sugar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting sugar in half and adding a teaspoon of vanilla as a replacement can give just as much flavor with significantly fewer calories. Assuming the recipe originally calls for one cup of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/sweets/5592/2&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, that&rsquo;s already almost 400 calories cut out! You can't sub this one in equal ratios, but next time you're whipping up some cookies, try cutting 2 tablespoons of sugar and adding an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Baking_MashedBanana.png?itok=ZIf_uNqd&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use mashed banana instead of fats&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;11. Mashed bananas for fats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creamy, thickening-power of mashed (ripe!) banana acts the same as avocado in terms of replacing fat in baking recipes. The consistency is ideal, and the bananas add nutrients like potassium, fiber, and vitamin B6. One cup of mashed banana works perfectly in place of 1 cup or butter or oil!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;12. Nut flours for flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: Nut flours don&rsquo;t rise the same way as wheat flour so an additional rising agent might be needed when replacing more than &frac14; cup of wheat. Many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elanaspantry.com/ingredients/blanched-almond-flour/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gluten-free blogs&lt;/a&gt; detail how to streamline nut flour-based baking. And while these flours are typically higher in calories and fat, they also have more fiber and protein. Nut flours do tend to be heavier than classic wheat, so make sure to up the amount of baking powder and baking soda in the recipe so the dough can rise as normal. Another option is to replace only part of the flour in a recipe with nut flour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;13. Coconut flour for flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High in fiber and low in carbohydrates, coconut flour is a great partial substitute for wheat flour in baking recipes. Be careful, though&mdash;using more than half a cup at a time could allow the flour&rsquo;s bitterness to take over. Substitutes can be tricky in baking, so when using coconut flour, be sure to add an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_7/cooking_with_coconut_flour-1955-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;equal amount&lt;/a&gt; of extra liquid! In baked goods, you generally want to substitute only 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour for 1 cup of wheat flour. (Take a look at this easy-to-understand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gygi.com/ohg-chart-understanding-coconut-flour.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; for more specific substitution instructions!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;14. Meringue for frosting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made from just egg whites and sugar, meringue can be a great fat-free substitution for traditional frosting. Feel like going a step further? Take a torch to it. Lightly charring the edges of the meringue can add a nice caramelized flavor. (Not to mention a cool visual effect!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Baking_GrahamCrackers.png?itok=KZ1GjqwK&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use graham crackers in pie crust instead of cookies&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;15. Graham crackers for cookies (in pie crusts)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&rsquo;t love a fresh baked cookie-crust pie? Next time, refrain from the traditional sugar or Oreo cookie crust and grab the graham crackers. Reduced-fat graham crackers offer the same consistency and flavor with about half the calories of the conventional options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;16. Evaporated skim milk for cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the same consistency with a fraction of the fat. Evaporated milk tends to have a bit more sugar (only about 2 grams), but the major drop in fat content is well worth the switch. This substitute is an even swap, too (1 cup cream = 1 cup evaporated milk)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;17. Stevia for sugar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural sweetener &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/sugar-alternatives/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stevia&lt;/a&gt; is lower in calories and up to 300 times sweeter than sugar. But watch the grocery bill&mdash;this fashionable sweetener can also cost up to 5 times as much as granulated sugar. Since it's so much sweeter, swap with caution: A recipe calling for 1 cup of sugar should be swapped for 1 teaspoon liquid stevia (or about 2 tablespoons stevia powder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;18. Prunes for butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brownies and other dark baked goods, prune puree makes for a perfect butter substitute while cutting more than half the calories and fat. Combine 3/4 cup prunes with 1/4 cup boiling water, and puree to combine. Sub in equal amounts in most dark baked good recipes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Baking_Cacao.png?itok=JEPo8Icc&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;19. Cacao nibs for chocolate chips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News flash: Those chocolate chips &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; start out as cacao nibs&mdash;the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/blogs/vitamin-g/2009/03/5-weird-foods-you-should-learn.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;roasted bits of cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt; that then get ground down and turned in to chocolate. Opting for these unprocessed (or at least &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;processed) morsels cuts out the additives and added sugar in chocolate, while also delving out a healthy dose of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;20. Chia seeds for butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funny lookin' little seeds are good for more than just growing countertop pets. Combine 1 tablespoon chia seeds with 9 tablespoons water, let sit for 15 minutes, and you get a gel that's the perfect consistency to stand in for fat in baking recipes. One word of caution: don't try to cut out &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the fat with this substitute&mdash;it works best when subbing an equal amount of this mixture for half of the fat in a recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;21. Chia seeds for eggs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise! Combining 1 tablespoon chia seeds with 1 cup of water left to sit for 15 minutes yields a perfect 1-to-1 egg substitute for baking. (But we probably wouldn't suggest subbing chia for butter &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; eggs in the same recipe!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;22. Flax meal for eggs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one's an old vegan trick. Mix 1 tablespoon ground flax seeds (aka flax meal) with 3 tablespoons of warm water and whisk with a fork to combine. Now let it sit in the fridge for 5-10 minutes before subbing for 1 egg in any baked recipe. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Smarter Carbs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;23. Brown rice for white rice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When white rice is processed, the &quot;brown&quot; bran layer gets stripped away, cutting out essential nutrients (like fiber). Opt for &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/brown-rice-vs-white-rice/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;brown rice&lt;/a&gt; for a fuller nutritional profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;24. Quinoa for couscous&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While couscous is made from processed wheat flour, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/quinoa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt; is a whole-grain superfood packed with protein and nutrients. Bonus points: They have almost the exact same texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Carbs_Zucchini.png?itok=1Cp8vvqU&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use zucchini ribbons instead of pasta&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;25. Zucchini ribbons for pasta&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin strips or ribbons of zucchini are a great stand in for carb-packed pastas. Plus, it&rsquo;s one excuse to skip the boiling&mdash;simply sautee for a few minutes until soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;26. Turnip mash for mashed potatoes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one cup of mashed potatoes made with whole milk racks up about &lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2759/2&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;180 calories&lt;/a&gt; (and that's &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the inevitable salt and butter), a cup of mashed turnip (which doesn&rsquo;t need milk or butter to get that creamy consistency) has only &lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2700/2&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;51 calories&lt;/a&gt;. Add some fresh herbs &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/21-lower-sodium-solutions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in place of the salt&lt;/a&gt; and it&rsquo;s a much healthier stand-in for classic mash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;27. Grated steamed cauliflower for rice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut both calories and carbs with this simple switch. The texture is virtually the same, as is the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Carbs_Cauliflower.png?itok=8Od33M4V&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use mashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;28. Mashed cauliflower for mashed potatoes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the turnip mash, mashed cauliflower has only a fraction of the calories of potatoes and it's nearly impossible to taste the difference. Got picky eaters at the table? Try mixing half potato, half cauliflower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;29. Rolled oats for breadcrumbs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While breadcrumbs can pack extra sodium, using rolled oats seasoned with herbs is a great way to sneak another whole grain into any meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;30. Whole wheat pasta for regular pasta&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as with bread, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/is-whole-wheat-pasta-healthier/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;whole wheat pasta&lt;/a&gt; beats regular with a higher fiber content and about 50 fewer calories per serving (depending on the brand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;31. Crushed flax or fiber cereal for bread crumbs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crushing a fiber-rich cereal and mixing it with some herbs makes an easy lower-sodium substitution for traditional breadcrumbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;32. Spaghetti squash for pasta&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasted and pulled apart with a fork, spaghetti squash is a great low-carb and lower-calorie substitute for pasta. One squash will make between two and three servings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Carbs_Pita.png?itok=L6_vuHsd&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use pita bread instead of bread&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;33. Pita for bread&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One 4-inch whole-wheat pita runs around 80 calories and only 1 gram of fat (though there is some variation from brand to brand). Two slices of whole-wheat bread typically comes in at around 138 calories!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;34. Lettuce leaves for tortilla wraps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a perfect swap, but forgoing the carbs for fresh lettuce is a fun (and easy) switch that can lighten up any wrap or taco dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;35. Corn tortilla for flour tortilla&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the calories and fat. &lsquo;Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;36. Whole wheat bread for white bread&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've heard it all before, but it's just that important! Whole-grain wheat beats out processed white with a complete nutrition profile &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; better flavor and texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use quinoa instead of oatmeal&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;37. Quinoa for oatmeal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooked with milk (cow, almond, hemp&mdash;whatever&rsquo;s on hand) and some cinnamon, quinoa makes a perfect protein-packed hot breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;38. Steel-cut oatmeal for instant oatmeal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chewy and a little crunchy, these guys are nothing like their instant oatmeal cousins. While rolled oats are&mdash;literally&mdash;rolled into a flat grain, steel cut oats are diced whole grains that maintain more of their fiber-rich shell. Rich in B vitamins, calcium, and protein, steel-cut oats also lack the added sugar that often comes with instant varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Healthier Proteins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;39. Dry beans for canned beans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canned beans are convenient, sure, but they also tend to have excess sodium and plenty of preservatives. Plus, even though the canned versions are dirt cheap, dried beans are even cheaper! It may take a little more work (just some simple soaking and boiling), but this switch is still well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

          alt=&quot;Use prosciutto or pancetta instead of bacon&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;40. Prosciutto or pancetta for bacon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacon is often the go-to for that smoky flavor in savory dishes (and even in some &lt;a href=&quot;http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26092641/ns/today-food/t/bacon-makes-everything-better-even-chocolate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sweet ones&lt;/a&gt;). But opting for a few slices of prosciutto or pancetta can help cut both calories and fat. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/oscar-mayer-bacon-original-center-cut-11641313&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bacon&lt;/a&gt; has about 70 calories and 6 grams of fat for two slices, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/parma-prosciutto-di-parma-7010513&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prosciutto&lt;/a&gt; has just 30 calories and 4 grams in an equally weighted sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;41. Two egg whites for one whole egg&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One egg yolk holds more than half the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholesterol/HQ00608&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;recommended daily cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; for the average adult. Trading out the yolk for a second white will cut out the cholesterol while doubling the protein. If making a dish that requires more eggs, keep one to two yolks for their rich vitamins A, E, D, and K content, but consider swapping out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;42. White-meat, skinless poultry or dark-meat poultry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f The biggest chicken debate to date: white meat vs. dark meat. And the white meat has it beat&mdash;lower in calories and fat, higher in protein and iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;43. Egg Beaters for egg yolks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid substitution for many egg dishes (like omelets or frittatas)&mdash;and even for something more complicated, like Hollandaise sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;44. Bison for beef&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher in B vitamins and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/bison_from_farm_to_table/index.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lower in fat&lt;/a&gt;, bison is a great substitute for the ol&rsquo; beefy standard. (When available, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Proteins_GroundTurkey.png?itok=K8zctPc_&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use ground turkey instead of ground beef&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;45. Ground Turkey for ground beef&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground turkey (or chicken) is a great substitute for ground beef to cut down on saturated fat and calories. Reminder: Because of the lower fat content, ground poultry often ends up drier than beef, but a few tablespoons of chicken stock can solve the problem in a snap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;46. Quinoa and ground turkey for rice and ground beef (in stuffed peppers)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More protein and antioxidants in the quinoa and less fat in the ground turkey make this an all-around healthier option for this popular side dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Snacks, Sides &amp;amp; Sweets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;47. Veggies for pita (as a dipping tool)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the pita. Fresh veggies work as killer dippers with hummus and contain both fewer carbs and more vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;48. Cauliflower puree for egg yolks (in deviled eggs)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that devilish Southern favorite&mdash;deviled eggs&mdash;try replacing half the yolks in the filling with cauliflower puree. The taste remains the same, as does the texture, but without the extra dose of cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Snacks_Yogurt.png?itok=FieATWAa&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use plain yogurt instead of flavored&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;49. Plain yogurt with fresh fruit for flavored yogurt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-flavored yogurts often come packed with extra sugar. To skip the sugar rush without sacrificing flavor, opt for plain yogurt (or better yet, plain &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/greek-yogurt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;) and add fresh fruit and/or honey or agave for a hint of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;50. Arugula, romaine, spinach, and/or kale for iceberg lettuce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/salad-greens/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;All greens&lt;/a&gt; are not created equal. Darker greens usually mean more nutrients like iron, vitamin C, and antioxidants. Sorry, iceberg&rsquo;s just not cutting it anymore&mdash;go out and get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatist.com/health/superfood-kale/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;grown-up greens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;51. Frozen or fresh fruits for canned fruit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut down on excess sugar and preservatives by choosing fresh or flash-frozen varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;52. Edamame hummus for regular hummus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hummus might look innocent from the sidelines, it's on our list of potential &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/tag/Dangerfood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dangerfoods&lt;/a&gt;, packed with more than 50 calories in two tablespoons. That&rsquo;s why switching to an edamame-based hummus can help reduce the danger (read: fat and calories) while still providing a delicious dip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Snacks_KaleChips.png?itok=Ulq3TXW_&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use kale chips instead of potato chips&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;53. Kale chips for potato chips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would&rsquo;ve guessed that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/superfood-kale/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;leafy green&lt;/a&gt; could make such delicious chips? When lightly tossed in olive oil and some seasoning (salt and pepper, paprika, or chili powder work well) and baked, these curly greens turn into a delightfully delicate &lt;a href=&quot;http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/baked-kale-chips/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;crunchy snack&lt;/a&gt; with less fat than the classic fried potato chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;54. Dark chocolate for M&amp;amp;Ms (in trail mix)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with most trail mixes? They pack in the sugar-filled, candy-coated chocolate and dried fruit. Instead, make your own trail mix with unsalted nuts and dark chocolate bits (lower in sugar), which are high in free-radical-fighting flavonoids&mdash;a benefit that completely outweighs that candy-coated sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;55. Popcorn for potato chips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower in calories and fat, natural popcorn without pre-flavored seasonings is a great snack alternative to replace those oily, super-salty potato chips. Try made-at-home flavors by adding cinnamon, chili powder, or Parmesan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;56. Banana ice cream for ice cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No milk, no cream, no sugar&hellip; but the same, delicious consistency. &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/general/banana-ice-cream/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It&rsquo;s simple&lt;/a&gt;: freeze bananas, then puree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Snacks_Fries.png?itok=gPkGhqWX&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use sweet potato fries instead of regular fries&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;57. Sweet potato fries for French fries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opting for sweet potatoes rather than the traditional white adds an extra dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2667/2&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;fiber, and vitamins A, C, and B6&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it cuts out roughly 20 grams of carbohydrates per one-cup serving. Just don't overdo it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;58. Frozen yogurt for ice cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/frozen-yogurt-vs-sorbet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frozen yogurt&lt;/a&gt; over ice cream can help cut down fat content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Condiments &amp;amp; Sauces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;59. Coconut milk for cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coconut milk is a great substitute for heavy cream in soups and stews. And don&rsquo;t be turned off by the word &ldquo;coconut&rdquo;&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t taste like the sweetened shredded kind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Condiments_GreekYogurt.png?itok=Ng8G-ANL&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;60. Greek yogurt for sour cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the fat and calories, yet the taste and texture are virtually identical. Plus, nonfat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatist.com/health/greek-yogurt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; offers an extra dose of lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;61. Greek yogurt for mayo (in tuna/chicken salad)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add some herbs and a squeeze of lemon juice, and they&rsquo;ll taste almost identical. Plus, this swap will save on calories and fat, and provide an extra dose of protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;62. Nutritional yeast for cheese&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste and texture are a little bit different, but the creamy gooiness is pretty comparable. Instead of topping that taco with cheddar, try a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavoring with much less fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Condiments_Nuts.png?itok=uUpkDL1U&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use nuts instead of croutons in salad&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;63. Nuts for croutons (in salads)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every salad needs that extra crunch. But rather than getting the extra carbs (and often fat and sodium) that come with croutons, try some lightly toasted slivered almonds, pecans, or walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;64. Avocado mash for mayo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a mashed avocado is a great substitute for mayo on any sandwich. Both give some moisture, but avocado packs a big dose of vitamin E and cholesterol-checking monosaturated fat. And while a typical two-tablespoon serving of mayonnaise has about 206 calories and 24 grams of fat, half an avocado has only 114 calories and 10.5 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;65. Sliced tomatoes for tomato sauce (on pizza)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut out the extra sodium, sugar, and preservatives by replacing jarred tomato sauce with fresh sliced tomatoes. The texture is a bit different, but the flavor is much more vibrant and fresh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;66. Low-fat cottage cheese for sour cream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both add a creamy texture to many dishes, but sour cream is packed with fat while low-fat cottage cheese is packed with protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;67. Pureed fruit for syrup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sweeten flapjacks or a nice whole-wheat waffle, but pureed fruit warmed on the stovetop with a bit of honey packs much less sugar than classic maple. Plus, it provides an extra dose of antioxidants and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Condiments_HerbsCitrus.png?itok=DBBTqIOe&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use herbs or citrus juice instead of salt&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;68. Herbs or citrus juice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for salt You heard it here first: Food doesn&rsquo;t need to be salted to taste good! Fresh herbs and citrus juice can provide just as much flavor without the added &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/21/salt.intake/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; of excess sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;69. Garlic powder for salt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like fresh herbs, garlic powder can provide a flavorful-punch without adding sodium. A word of warning, though: don't mistake garlic &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt; for garlic &lt;em&gt;salt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;70. Low-sodium soy sauce for standard soy sauce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste is virtually the same, but choosing a low- or reduced-sodium variety can cut down sodium intake by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;71. Homemade salad dressing for bottled dressing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making dressing from scratch at home, it's easy to cut out the added sugar, sodium, and preservatives typically found in pre-made dressings. Try mixing vinegar or lemon juice and oil in a 2:1 ratio and flavoring with spices like rosemary, thyme, oregano, and pepper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Drinks &amp;amp; Booze&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;72. Seltzer water with citrus slice instead of soda&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of sugary sodas, opt for a glass of sparkling water with a few slices of citrus&mdash;grapefruit, lime, orange, and lemon all work well&mdash;for a little extra flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;73. Skim milk for whole or 2% milk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer calories and fat with the same amount of protein makes this switch well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Drinks_Cinnamon.png?itok=tvrGQMqy&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use cinnamon in coffee instead of cream and sugar&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;74. Cinnamon for cream and sugar (in coffee)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting out the cream and sugar in favor of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/cinnamon-in-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sprinkle of cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; can cut up to 70 calories per cup. Plus, cinnamon can &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/cinnamon-in-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;boost metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;75. Unsweetened iced tea for juice or bottled teas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While delicious and convenient, bottled teas, juices, and sports drinks are packed with sugar and calories. When in the mood for something icy with a little flavor, opt for a home-brewed, unsweetened iced tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;76. Americano for latte&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by cutting the milk out of that daily latte in favor of hot water, the calorie count drops by more than 150. It's a smart switch, especially by the fourth or fifth cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Drinks_Wine.png?itok=rHA3-kf5&quot;

          alt=&quot;Drink red wine instead of white&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;77. Red wine for white wine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While white wine is usually lower in calories, red offers &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/red-wine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; unmatched by the white stuff, including cancer-fighting compounds and natural cholesterol checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;78. Soda water for juice (as a mixer)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rum and coke. Cranberry and vodka. Sure, these &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/eat-healthy-at-the-bar/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sugary mixers&lt;/a&gt; take care of the inner sweet tooth. But try mixing liquor with soda water and a slice of fruit (or even just a &lt;em&gt;splash&lt;/em&gt; of juice) and down goes the sugar (and calorie) count. Not inventive enough? Check out these &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/60-healthier-drinks-for-boozing-030712/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;60 healthier cocktails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;79. Soda water for tonic water&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&rsquo;s clear and bubbly, just like soda water, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatist.com/health/dangerfood-tonic-water-032712/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tonic water&lt;/a&gt; is actually full of sugar. Adding plain soda water and a pinch of lime gives almost the same taste with 32 grams less sugar per 12 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cooking Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;80. Olive oil spray for olive oil from the bottle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil glugs out of the bottle, leading to overly-greasy dishes. Using a spray bottle is a great way to cut down on oil while still getting the non-stick benefits. A little mist is all that&rsquo;s needed!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Cooking_OliveOil.png?itok=enFd3mml&quot;

          alt=&quot;Use olive oil instead of butter&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;81.Olive oil for butter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When cooking eggs, this simple switch is a great way to cut down on saturated fats while getting a healthy dose of essential &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatist.com/health/need-omega-3-fat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;82. Oven or pan-frying for deep frying&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, those chicken tenders are deliciously greasy, but by foregoing the oil bath for just a misting of oil in a pan or oven, it&rsquo;s easy to cut fat without sacrificing flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span
  class=&quot;media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;img
    src=&quot;http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Cooking_Steaming.png?itok=fcknsli9&quot;

          alt=&quot;Steam instead of boiling&quot;
    
        class=&quot;media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image&quot;
  /&gt;

  
  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;83. Steaming for boiling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both are great options for meats and veggies, steaming is king because it removes fewer nutrients from vegetables. While boiling can leech out some of the better nutrients (hence why water turns green after boiling broccoli), steaming keeps all that green goodness inside the veggies. &lt;em&gt;Did we miss one of your favorites?

<p>Here at Greatist, we're always looking for ways to make our favorite foods healthier without sacrificing flavor. So we compiled a list of our best substitutions and discovered some new ones along the way. Below are our 83 (!) top picks, guaranteed to make that next meal a delicious, healthier hit. It wasn't easy taste-testing all this food, but someone sure had to. Right?</p>

<h3>Baking hacks</h3>

<h4>1. Black beans for flour</h4>

<p>Swapping out flour for a can of <a href="http://blogs.babble.com/family-kitchen/2011/01/21/gluten-freeblack-bean-brownies/" rel="nofollow">black beans</a> (drained and rinsed, of course) in brownies is a great way to cut out the gluten and fit in an extra dose of protein, Plus, they taste <em>great</em>. When baking, swap out 1 cup flour for 1 cup black bean puree (about a 15oz can).</p>

[AD]

<h4>2. Whole wheat flour for white flour</h4>

<p>In virtually any baked good, replacing white flour with whole wheat can add a whole new dimension of nutrients, flavor, and texture. Because whole wheat includes the outer shell of the grain, it also provides an extra punch of fiber, which aids in digestion and can even <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033" rel="">lower the risk </a>of diabetes and heart disease. For every cup of white flour, substitute 7/8 cup of whole-wheat.</p>

          alt="Use unsweetened applesauce instead of sugar"
    
        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>3. Unsweetened applesauce for sugar</h4>

<p>Using applesauce in place of sugar can give the necessary sweetness without the extra calories and, well, sugar. While one cup of unsweetened applesauce contains only about 100 calories, a cup of sugar can pack in more than 770 calories! This swap is <em>perfect</em> for <a href="http://www.delish.com/recipefinder/applesauce-cookies-recipes-sugar-free" rel="nofollow">oatmeal raisin cookies</a>. Pro tip: You can sub sugar for apple sauce in a 1:1 ratio, but for every cup of applesauce you use, reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by 1/4 cup.</p>

<h4>4. Unsweetened applesauce for oil or butter</h4>

<p>Don’t knock this one till you’ve tried it. The applesauce gives the right consistency and a hint of sweetness without all the fat of oil or butter. This works well in any sweet bread, like banana or zucchini, or in muffins (like in these <a href="http://www.yummly.com/recipe/Blueberry-Low_fat-Muffins-Recipezaar" rel="nofollow">low-fat blueberry muffins</a>)—and even with pre-boxed mixes! On your first try, only try swapping out half the fat (so a recipe using 1 cup of oil would use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce). If you can't tell the difference with that swap, try swapping a bit more of the fat next time around.</p>

<h4>5. Almond flour for wheat flour</h4>

<p>This gluten-free switch gives any baked good a dose of protein, omega-3s, and a delicious nutty flavor. Check out these classic <a href="http://www.elanaspantry.com/butter-cookies/" rel="nofollow">butter cookies</a> for a simple example. A word of advice: almond flour is much heavier than other baking flours, so when subbing go 1/4 cup at a time (so 1 cup wheat flour would become 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1/4 cup almond flour). Or, if it's all or nothing for your recipe, remember to increase the amount of rising agent (by about 1/2 teaspoon per cup of almond flour added) to account for the extra weight.</p>

<h4>6. Avocado puree for butter</h4>

<p>They’re both fats (albeit <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262" rel="">very different fats</a>) and have nearly the same consistency at room temperature. The creaminess and subtle flavor of the avocado lends itself well to the texture of fudge brownies and dark chocolate flavorings. Check out <a href="http://www.thesimplelens.com/2011/05/byeeee-byeeee-brownie/" rel="nofollow">this recipe</a> for perfect proportion guidelines. It can take some experimenting to get this swap perfect, but generally, using 1 cup of avocado puree per cup of butter works.</p>

<h4>7. Brown rice cereal with flax meal for Rice Crispies</h4>

<p>Brown puffed rice has the same texture as conventional white rice, but with half the calories. The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/flaxseed/AN01258" rel="">flax</a> adds extra fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and phytochemicals to the mix without compromising flavor!</p>

<h4>8. Marshmallow Fluff for frosting</h4>

<p>Replacing the fat and sugar in frosting with marshmallow achieves the perfect consistency with <em>many</em> fewer calories. While two tablespoons of marshmallow has just 40 calories and 6 grams of sugar (and no fat!), the same amount of conventional frosting can pack up to 100 calories, 14 grams of sugar, and 5 grams of fat. Need we go on?</p>

<h4>9. Natural peanut butter for reduced-fat peanut butter</h4>

<p>While they may appear better than traditional Skippy or Jiff, reduced fat versions of peanut butter can actually have more sugar—and an extra-long list of artificial additives—than the classics. Natural peanut butter (preferably unsalted) provides the same sweetness without call the extra junk.</p>

<h4>10. Vanilla for sugar</h4>

<p>Cutting sugar in half and adding a teaspoon of vanilla as a replacement can give just as much flavor with significantly fewer calories. Assuming the recipe originally calls for one cup of <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/sweets/5592/2" rel="">sugar</a>, that’s already almost 400 calories cut out! You can't sub this one in equal ratios, but next time you're whipping up some cookies, try cutting 2 tablespoons of sugar and adding an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"

  </span>

<h4>11. Mashed bananas for fats</h4>

<p>The creamy, thickening-power of mashed (ripe!) banana acts the same as avocado in terms of replacing fat in baking recipes. The consistency is ideal, and the bananas add nutrients like potassium, fiber, and vitamin B6. One cup of mashed banana works perfectly in place of 1 cup or butter or oil!</p>

<h4>12. Nut flours for flour</h4>

<p>A word of caution: Nut flours don’t rise the same way as wheat flour so an additional rising agent might be needed when replacing more than ¼ cup of wheat. Many <a href="http://www.elanaspantry.com/ingredients/blanched-almond-flour/" rel="nofollow">gluten-free blogs</a> detail how to streamline nut flour-based baking. And while these flours are typically higher in calories and fat, they also have more fiber and protein. Nut flours do tend to be heavier than classic wheat, so make sure to up the amount of baking powder and baking soda in the recipe so the dough can rise as normal. Another option is to replace only part of the flour in a recipe with nut flour!</p>

<h4>13. Coconut flour for flour</h4>

<p>High in fiber and low in carbohydrates, coconut flour is a great partial substitute for wheat flour in baking recipes. Be careful, though—using more than half a cup at a time could allow the flour’s bitterness to take over. Substitutes can be tricky in baking, so when using coconut flour, be sure to add an <a href="http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_7/cooking_with_coconut_flour-1955-1.html" rel="nofollow">equal amount</a> of extra liquid! In baked goods, you generally want to substitute only 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour for 1 cup of wheat flour. (Take a look at this easy-to-understand <a href="http://www.gygi.com/ohg-chart-understanding-coconut-flour.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chart</a> for more specific substitution instructions!)</p>

<h4>14. Meringue for frosting</h4>

<p>Made from just egg whites and sugar, meringue can be a great fat-free substitution for traditional frosting. Feel like going a step further? Take a torch to it. Lightly charring the edges of the meringue can add a nice caramelized flavor. (Not to mention a cool visual effect!)</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>15. Graham crackers for cookies (in pie crusts)</h4>

<p>Who doesn’t love a fresh baked cookie-crust pie? Next time, refrain from the traditional sugar or Oreo cookie crust and grab the graham crackers. Reduced-fat graham crackers offer the same consistency and flavor with about half the calories of the conventional options.</p>

<h4>16. Evaporated skim milk for cream</h4>

<p>It's the same consistency with a fraction of the fat. Evaporated milk tends to have a bit more sugar (only about 2 grams), but the major drop in fat content is well worth the switch. This substitute is an even swap, too (1 cup cream = 1 cup evaporated milk)!</p>

<h4>17. Stevia for sugar</h4>

<p>The natural sweetener <a href="http://greatist.com/health/sugar-alternatives/" rel="nofollow">stevia</a> is lower in calories and up to 300 times sweeter than sugar. But watch the grocery bill—this fashionable sweetener can also cost up to 5 times as much as granulated sugar. Since it's so much sweeter, swap with caution: A recipe calling for 1 cup of sugar should be swapped for 1 teaspoon liquid stevia (or about 2 tablespoons stevia powder).</p>

<h4>18. Prunes for butter</h4>

<p>In brownies and other dark baked goods, prune puree makes for a perfect butter substitute while cutting more than half the calories and fat. Combine 3/4 cup prunes with 1/4 cup boiling water, and puree to combine. Sub in equal amounts in most dark baked good recipes!</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>19. Cacao nibs for chocolate chips</h4>

<p>News flash: Those chocolate chips <em>actually</em> start out as cacao nibs—the <a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/blogs/vitamin-g/2009/03/5-weird-foods-you-should-learn.html" rel="nofollow">roasted bits of cocoa beans</a> that then get ground down and turned in to chocolate. Opting for these unprocessed (or at least <em>less </em>processed) morsels cuts out the additives and added sugar in chocolate, while also delving out a healthy dose of antioxidants.</p>

<h4>20. Chia seeds for butter</h4>

<p>These funny lookin' little seeds are good for more than just growing countertop pets. Combine 1 tablespoon chia seeds with 9 tablespoons water, let sit for 15 minutes, and you get a gel that's the perfect consistency to stand in for fat in baking recipes. One word of caution: don't try to cut out <em>all </em>the fat with this substitute—it works best when subbing an equal amount of this mixture for half of the fat in a recipe.</p>

<h4>21. Chia seeds for eggs</h4>

<p>Surprise! Combining 1 tablespoon chia seeds with 1 cup of water left to sit for 15 minutes yields a perfect 1-to-1 egg substitute for baking. (But we probably wouldn't suggest subbing chia for butter <em>and</em> eggs in the same recipe!)</p>

<h4>22. Flax meal for eggs</h4>

<p>This one's an old vegan trick. Mix 1 tablespoon ground flax seeds (aka flax meal) with 3 tablespoons of warm water and whisk with a fork to combine. Now let it sit in the fridge for 5-10 minutes before subbing for 1 egg in any baked recipe. Voila!</p>

<h3>Smarter Carbs</h3>

<h4>23. Brown rice for white rice</h4>

<p>When white rice is processed, the "brown" bran layer gets stripped away, cutting out essential nutrients (like fiber). Opt for <a href="http://greatist.com/health/brown-rice-vs-white-rice/" rel="nofollow">brown rice</a> for a fuller nutritional profile.</p>

<h4>24. Quinoa for couscous</h4>

<p>While couscous is made from processed wheat flour, <a href="http://greatist.com/health/quinoa/" rel="nofollow">quinoa</a> is a whole-grain superfood packed with protein and nutrients. Bonus points: They have almost the exact same texture.</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>25. Zucchini ribbons for pasta</h4>

<p>Thin strips or ribbons of zucchini are a great stand in for carb-packed pastas. Plus, it’s one excuse to skip the boiling—simply sautee for a few minutes until soft.</p>

<h4>26. Turnip mash for mashed potatoes</h4>

<p>While one cup of mashed potatoes made with whole milk racks up about <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2759/2" rel="">180 calories</a> (and that's <em>before</em> the inevitable salt and butter), a cup of mashed turnip (which doesn’t need milk or butter to get that creamy consistency) has only <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2700/2" rel="">51 calories</a>. Add some fresh herbs <a href="http://greatist.com/health/21-lower-sodium-solutions/" rel="nofollow">in place of the salt</a> and it’s a much healthier stand-in for classic mash.</p>

<h4>27. Grated steamed cauliflower for rice</h4>

<p>Cut both calories and carbs with this simple switch. The texture is virtually the same, as is the taste.</p>

<span
  class="media media-element-container media-g_full_width_inline_image"

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>28. Mashed cauliflower for mashed potatoes</h4>

<p>Just like the turnip mash, mashed cauliflower has only a fraction of the calories of potatoes and it's nearly impossible to taste the difference. Got picky eaters at the table? Try mixing half potato, half cauliflower.</p>

<h4>29. Rolled oats for breadcrumbs</h4>

<p>While breadcrumbs can pack extra sodium, using rolled oats seasoned with herbs is a great way to sneak another whole grain into any meal.</p>

<h4>30. Whole wheat pasta for regular pasta</h4>

<p>Just as with bread, <a href="http://greatist.com/health/is-whole-wheat-pasta-healthier/" rel="nofollow">whole wheat pasta</a> beats regular with a higher fiber content and about 50 fewer calories per serving (depending on the brand).</p>

<h4>31. Crushed flax or fiber cereal for bread crumbs</h4>

<p>Crushing a fiber-rich cereal and mixing it with some herbs makes an easy lower-sodium substitution for traditional breadcrumbs.</p>

<h4>32. Spaghetti squash for pasta</h4>

<p>Roasted and pulled apart with a fork, spaghetti squash is a great low-carb and lower-calorie substitute for pasta. One squash will make between two and three servings.</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"
  />

  
  </span>

<h4>33. Pita for bread</h4>

<p>One 4-inch whole-wheat pita runs around 80 calories and only 1 gram of fat (though there is some variation from brand to brand). Two slices of whole-wheat bread typically comes in at around 138 calories!</p>

<h4>34. Lettuce leaves for tortilla wraps</h4>

<p>It's not a perfect swap, but forgoing the carbs for fresh lettuce is a fun (and easy) switch that can lighten up any wrap or taco dish.</p>

<h4>35. Corn tortilla for flour tortilla</h4>

<p>Half the calories and fat. ‘Nuff said.</p>

<h4>36. Whole wheat bread for white bread</h4>

<p>You've heard it all before, but it's just that important! Whole-grain wheat beats out processed white with a complete nutrition profile <em>and</em> better flavor and texture.</p>

  </span>

<h4>37. Quinoa for oatmeal</h4>

<p>Cooked with milk (cow, almond, hemp—whatever’s on hand) and some cinnamon, quinoa makes a perfect protein-packed hot breakfast.</p>

<h4>38. Steel-cut oatmeal for instant oatmeal</h4>

<p>Chewy and a little crunchy, these guys are nothing like their instant oatmeal cousins. While rolled oats are—literally—rolled into a flat grain, steel cut oats are diced whole grains that maintain more of their fiber-rich shell. Rich in B vitamins, calcium, and protein, steel-cut oats also lack the added sugar that often comes with instant varieties.</p>

<h3>Healthier Proteins</h3>

<h4>39. Dry beans for canned beans</h4>

<p>Canned beans are convenient, sure, but they also tend to have excess sodium and plenty of preservatives. Plus, even though the canned versions are dirt cheap, dried beans are even cheaper! It may take a little more work (just some simple soaking and boiling), but this switch is still well worth it.</p>

  </span>

<h4>40. Prosciutto or pancetta for bacon</h4>

<p>Bacon is often the go-to for that smoky flavor in savory dishes (and even in some <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26092641/ns/today-food/t/bacon-makes-everything-better-even-chocolate/" rel="nofollow">sweet ones</a>). But opting for a few slices of prosciutto or pancetta can help cut both calories and fat. While <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/oscar-mayer-bacon-original-center-cut-11641313" rel="nofollow">bacon</a> has about 70 calories and 6 grams of fat for two slices, <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/parma-prosciutto-di-parma-7010513" rel="nofollow">prosciutto</a> has just 30 calories and 4 grams in an equally weighted sample.</p>

<h4>41. Two egg whites for one whole egg</h4>

<p>One egg yolk holds more than half the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholesterol/HQ00608" rel="">recommended daily cholesterol</a> for the average adult. Trading out the yolk for a second white will cut out the cholesterol while doubling the protein. If making a dish that requires more eggs, keep one to two yolks for their rich vitamins A, E, D, and K content, but consider swapping out the rest.</p>

<h4>42. White-meat, skinless poultry or dark-meat poultry</h4>

<p>f The biggest chicken debate to date: white meat vs. dark meat. And the white meat has it beat—lower in calories and fat, higher in protein and iron.</p>

<h4>43. Egg Beaters for egg yolks</h4>

<p>A solid substitution for many egg dishes (like omelets or frittatas)—and even for something more complicated, like Hollandaise sauce.</p>

<h4>44. Bison for beef</h4>

<p>Higher in B vitamins and <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/bison_from_farm_to_table/index.asp" rel="nofollow">lower in fat</a>, bison is a great substitute for the ol’ beefy standard. (When available, of course.)</p>

        class="media-element file-g-full-width-inline-image"

  </span>

<h4>45. Ground Turkey for ground beef</h4>

<p>Ground turkey (or chicken) is a great substitute for ground beef to cut down on saturated fat and calories. Reminder: Because of the lower fat content, ground poultry often ends up drier than beef, but a few tablespoons of chicken stock can solve the problem in a snap!</p>

<h4>46. Quinoa and ground turkey for rice and ground beef (in stuffed peppers)</h4>

<p>More protein and antioxidants in the quinoa and less fat in the ground turkey make this an all-around healthier option for this popular side dish.</p>

<h3>Snacks, Sides &amp; Sweets</h3>

<h4>47. Veggies for pita (as a dipping tool)</h4>

<p>Forget the pita. Fresh veggies work as killer dippers with hummus and contain both fewer carbs and more vitamins.</p>

<h4>48. Cauliflower puree for egg yolks (in deviled eggs)</h4>

<p>For that devilish Southern favorite—deviled eggs—try replacing half the yolks in the filling with cauliflower puree. The taste remains the same, as does the texture, but without the extra dose of cholesterol.</p>

<h4>49. Plain yogurt with fresh fruit for flavored yogurt</h4>

<p>Pre-flavored yogurts often come packed with extra sugar. To skip the sugar rush without sacrificing flavor, opt for plain yogurt (or better yet, plain <a href="http://greatist.com/health/greek-yogurt/" rel="nofollow">Greek yogurt</a>) and add fresh fruit and/or honey or agave for a hint of sweetness.</p>

<h4>50. Arugula, romaine, spinach, and/or kale for iceberg lettuce</h4>

<p><a href="http://greatist.com/health/salad-greens/" rel="nofollow">All greens</a> are not created equal. Darker greens usually mean more nutrients like iron, vitamin C, and antioxidants. Sorry, iceberg’s just not cutting it anymore—go out and get some <a href="http://www.greatist.com/health/superfood-kale/" rel="nofollow">grown-up greens</a>.</p>

<h4>51. Frozen or fresh fruits for canned fruit</h4>

<p>Cut down on excess sugar and preservatives by choosing fresh or flash-frozen varieties.</p>

<h4>52. Edamame hummus for regular hummus</h4>

<p>While hummus might look innocent from the sidelines, it's on our list of potential <a href="http://greatist.com/tag/Dangerfood/" rel="nofollow">dangerfoods</a>, packed with more than 50 calories in two tablespoons. That’s why switching to an edamame-based hummus can help reduce the danger (read: fat and calories) while still providing a delicious dip.</p>

<h4>53. Kale chips for potato chips</h4>

<p>Who would’ve guessed that a <a href="http://greatist.com/health/superfood-kale/" rel="nofollow">leafy green</a> could make such delicious chips? When lightly tossed in olive oil and some seasoning (salt and pepper, paprika, or chili powder work well) and baked, these curly greens turn into a delightfully delicate <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/baked-kale-chips/" rel="nofollow">crunchy snack</a> with less fat than the classic fried potato chip.</p>

<h4>54. Dark chocolate for M&amp;Ms (in trail mix)</h4>

<p>The problem with most trail mixes? They pack in the sugar-filled, candy-coated chocolate and dried fruit. Instead, make your own trail mix with unsalted nuts and dark chocolate bits (lower in sugar), which are high in free-radical-fighting flavonoids—a benefit that completely outweighs that candy-coated sweetness.</p>

<h4>55. Popcorn for potato chips</h4>

<p>Lower in calories and fat, natural popcorn without pre-flavored seasonings is a great snack alternative to replace those oily, super-salty potato chips. Try made-at-home flavors by adding cinnamon, chili powder, or Parmesan.</p>

<h4>56. Banana ice cream for ice cream</h4>

<p>No milk, no cream, no sugar… but the same, delicious consistency. <a href="http://greatist.com/general/banana-ice-cream/" rel="nofollow">It’s simple</a>: freeze bananas, then puree.</p>

<h4>57. Sweet potato fries for French fries</h4>

<p>Opting for sweet potatoes rather than the traditional white adds an extra dose of <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2667/2" rel="">fiber, and vitamins A, C, and B6</a>. Plus, it cuts out roughly 20 grams of carbohydrates per one-cup serving. Just don't overdo it!</p>

<h4>58. Frozen yogurt for ice cream</h4>

<p>Picking <a href="http://greatist.com/health/frozen-yogurt-vs-sorbet/" rel="nofollow">frozen yogurt</a> over ice cream can help cut down fat content!</p>

<h3>Condiments &amp; Sauces</h3>

<h4>59. Coconut milk for cream</h4>

<p>Coconut milk is a great substitute for heavy cream in soups and stews. And don’t be turned off by the word “coconut”—it doesn’t taste like the sweetened shredded kind!</p>

<h4>60. Greek yogurt for sour cream</h4>

<p>Half the fat and calories, yet the taste and texture are virtually identical. Plus, nonfat <a href="http://www.greatist.com/health/greek-yogurt/" rel="nofollow">Greek yogurt</a> offers an extra dose of lean protein.</p>

<h4>61. Greek yogurt for mayo (in tuna/chicken salad)</h4>

<p>Add some herbs and a squeeze of lemon juice, and they’ll taste almost identical. Plus, this swap will save on calories and fat, and provide an extra dose of protein.</p>

<h4>62. Nutritional yeast for cheese</h4>

<p>The taste and texture are a little bit different, but the creamy gooiness is pretty comparable. Instead of topping that taco with cheddar, try a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavoring with much less fat.</p>

<h4>63. Nuts for croutons (in salads)</h4>

<p>Every salad needs that extra crunch. But rather than getting the extra carbs (and often fat and sodium) that come with croutons, try some lightly toasted slivered almonds, pecans, or walnuts.</p>

<h4>64. Avocado mash for mayo</h4>

<p>Half a mashed avocado is a great substitute for mayo on any sandwich. Both give some moisture, but avocado packs a big dose of vitamin E and cholesterol-checking monosaturated fat. And while a typical two-tablespoon serving of mayonnaise has about 206 calories and 24 grams of fat, half an avocado has only 114 calories and 10.5 grams of fat.</p>

<h4>65. Sliced tomatoes for tomato sauce (on pizza)</h4>

<p>Cut out the extra sodium, sugar, and preservatives by replacing jarred tomato sauce with fresh sliced tomatoes. The texture is a bit different, but the flavor is much more vibrant and fresh!</p>

<h4>66. Low-fat cottage cheese for sour cream</h4>

<p>They both add a creamy texture to many dishes, but sour cream is packed with fat while low-fat cottage cheese is packed with protein.</p>

<h4>67. Pureed fruit for syrup</h4>

<p>Both sweeten flapjacks or a nice whole-wheat waffle, but pureed fruit warmed on the stovetop with a bit of honey packs much less sugar than classic maple. Plus, it provides an extra dose of antioxidants and vitamins.</p>

<p>for salt You heard it here first: Food doesn’t need to be salted to taste good! Fresh herbs and citrus juice can provide just as much flavor without the added <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/21/salt.intake/index.html" rel="nofollow">risks</a> of excess sodium intake.</p>

<h4>69. Garlic powder for salt</h4>

<p>Just like fresh herbs, garlic powder can provide a flavorful-punch without adding sodium. A word of warning, though: don't mistake garlic <em>powder</em> for garlic <em>salt.</em></p>

<h4>70. Low-sodium soy sauce for standard soy sauce</h4>

<p>The taste is virtually the same, but choosing a low- or reduced-sodium variety can cut down sodium intake by nearly half.</p>

<h4>71. Homemade salad dressing for bottled dressing</h4>

<p>By making dressing from scratch at home, it's easy to cut out the added sugar, sodium, and preservatives typically found in pre-made dressings. Try mixing vinegar or lemon juice and oil in a 2:1 ratio and flavoring with spices like rosemary, thyme, oregano, and pepper!</p>

<h3>Drinks &amp; Booze</h3>

<h4>72. Seltzer water with citrus slice instead of soda</h4>

<p>Instead of sugary sodas, opt for a glass of sparkling water with a few slices of citrus—grapefruit, lime, orange, and lemon all work well—for a little extra flavor.</p>

<h4>73. Skim milk for whole or 2% milk</h4>

<p>Fewer calories and fat with the same amount of protein makes this switch well worth it.</p>

<h4>74. Cinnamon for cream and sugar (in coffee)</h4>

<p>Cutting out the cream and sugar in favor of a <a href="http://greatist.com/health/cinnamon-in-coffee/" rel="nofollow">sprinkle of cinnamon</a> can cut up to 70 calories per cup. Plus, cinnamon can <a href="http://greatist.com/health/cinnamon-in-coffee/" rel="nofollow">boost metabolism</a>.</p>

<h4>75. Unsweetened iced tea for juice or bottled teas</h4>

<p>While delicious and convenient, bottled teas, juices, and sports drinks are packed with sugar and calories. When in the mood for something icy with a little flavor, opt for a home-brewed, unsweetened iced tea.</p>

<h4>76. Americano for latte</h4>

<p>Just by cutting the milk out of that daily latte in favor of hot water, the calorie count drops by more than 150. It's a smart switch, especially by the fourth or fifth cup.</p>

  </span>

<h4>77. Red wine for white wine</h4>

<p>While white wine is usually lower in calories, red offers <a href="http://greatist.com/health/red-wine/" rel="nofollow">health benefits</a> unmatched by the white stuff, including cancer-fighting compounds and natural cholesterol checks.</p>

<h4>78. Soda water for juice (as a mixer)</h4>

<p>Rum and coke. Cranberry and vodka. Sure, these <a href="http://greatist.com/health/eat-healthy-at-the-bar/" rel="nofollow">sugary mixers</a> take care of the inner sweet tooth. But try mixing liquor with soda water and a slice of fruit (or even just a <em>splash</em> of juice) and down goes the sugar (and calorie) count. Not inventive enough? Check out these <a href="http://greatist.com/health/60-healthier-drinks-for-boozing-030712/" rel="nofollow">60 healthier cocktails</a>.</p>

<h4>79. Soda water for tonic water</h4>

<p>Yes, it’s clear and bubbly, just like soda water, but <a href="http://greatist.com/health/dangerfood-tonic-water-032712/" rel="nofollow">tonic water</a> is actually full of sugar. Adding plain soda water and a pinch of lime gives almost the same taste with 32 grams less sugar per 12 ounces.</p>

<h3>Cooking Tips</h3>

<h4>80. Olive oil spray for olive oil from the bottle</h4>

<p>Oil glugs out of the bottle, leading to overly-greasy dishes. Using a spray bottle is a great way to cut down on oil while still getting the non-stick benefits. A little mist is all that’s needed!</p>

  </span>

<h4>81.Olive oil for butter</h4>

<h4> </h4>

<p>When cooking eggs, this simple switch is a great way to cut down on saturated fats while getting a healthy dose of essential <a href="http://www.greatist.com/health/need-omega-3-fat/" rel="nofollow">omega-3 fatty acids</a>.</p>

<h4>82. Oven or pan-frying for deep frying</h4>

<p>Yes, those chicken tenders are deliciously greasy, but by foregoing the oil bath for just a misting of oil in a pan or oven, it’s easy to cut fat without sacrificing flavor.</p>

  </span>

<h4>83. Steaming for boiling</h4>

<p>While both are great options for meats and veggies, steaming is king because it removes fewer nutrients from vegetables. While boiling can leech out some of the better nutrients (hence why water turns green after boiling broccoli), steaming keeps all that green goodness inside the veggies. <em>Did we miss one of your favorites?
